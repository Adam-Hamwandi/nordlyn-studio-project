# Nordlyn Studio

Welcome to Nordlyn Studio! This is my personal showcase and playground for building world-class digital experiences. I’m Adam Hamwandi, and this project is all about pushing the boundaries of frontend architecture, design systems, and scalable engineering.

## What is Nordlyn Studio?

Nordlyn Studio is a full-service digital studio concept. Here, I design, develop, and architect modern web solutions for startups, small businesses, and premium brands. This project is my way of demonstrating not just beautiful UI/UX, but also the kind of system thinking and code organization you’d expect from a senior software architect.

## Why This Project?

I wanted to create something that goes beyond a simple landing page. Nordlyn Studio is built to be scalable, maintainable, and ready for real-world business needs. Every decision—from the folder structure to the accessibility features—is intentional and reflects best practices from top tech companies.

## Key Features

- **7-1 SCSS Architecture:** Modular, scalable, and maintainable code organization.
- **Accessibility First:** Keyboard navigation, skip links, and ARIA labels.
- **SEO Optimized:** robots.txt, sitemap.xml, semantic HTML, and fast loading.
- **Multi-Page Ready:** Designed for expansion—services, portfolio, about, contact, blog, and more.
- **Performance Focused:** Lazy loading, font optimization, and minimal JS for speed.
- **Professional Design System:** BEM methodology, component-based SCSS, and clean separation of concerns.

## The Vision

This isn’t just a portfolio—it’s a foundation for real products and SaaS platforms. My goal is to show what’s possible when you combine design, engineering, and architecture. I’m building this as if I’m working for a FAANG company, but with my own creative twist.

## What’s Next?

- More pages and features
- JavaScript interactivity
- Full-stack expansion (Next.js, TypeScript, .NET, Azure)
- Real SaaS products built on this architecture

## Get in Touch

If you’re a recruiter, hiring manager, or fellow engineer, I’d love to connect! Check out the code, explore the structure, and reach out if you want to talk about building something amazing together.
